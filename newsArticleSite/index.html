                <p>The internet changed how the world worked! It was such a life changing event that everyone in the world was effected. Even those who did not directly access the internet, it would change their lives. But how did it effect the lives for students who were graduating? Did this new technology help them increase their earning potential? In a country that is ranked higher than many others, how did Canadian graduates from Secondary school get impacted?</p>
                <p>

                    Trying to help different areas of the country to equally gain benefits from new technology as one can imagine is hard. However, the internet did start to see more accessibility during the 2000's. The data shows that often in less populated areas, the increase in earnings and graduation rates showed no real increase when gaining more access to the Internet. While provinces which were technology hubs emerged and saw a increase. While this increase cannot be solely identified to technology, there seems to be a correlation.</p>

            <div class="col1">
                <p>This information can help graduates better navigate the waters to understand where technology is making an impact. If there is an impact occuring than there will be new jobs being created to help fill those technical jobs. It is also good to see the average weekly earnings as it can help give students a way to assess what sort of dollar amount they could make depending on which province they look to go to work.</p>
                <h4>Also helps Employers and Private Sector</h4>

                <p>Understanding where technology is being welcomed can lead to companies placing more resources to growth in these provinces. Which will also a benefit for prospect graduate students.</p>
